🔬 SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY FRAMEWORK - MANDATORY:
${detailedRequirements}

🔬 UNIVERSAL SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS:

- If proposing investigational elements, explicitly label as "[INVESTIGATIONAL - REQUIRES VALIDATION]"
- Base ALL mechanisms of action on published biological pathways with appropriate citations
- Include realistic data ranges derived from actual clinical experience, not arbitrary numbers
- Distinguish clearly between hypothesis-generating observations and validated clinical evidence
- Ground all therapeutic rationales in established pathophysiology

- Generate statistically justified sample sizes based on study objectives and power requirements
- Include comprehensive safety monitoring frameworks with predefined stopping rules
- Specify appropriate regulatory pathway (IND, IDE, etc.) with corresponding requirements

⚖️ ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS - MANDATORY:
- Prioritize patient safety in all design decisions
- Include appropriate risk-benefit assessments

- Reference relevant regulatory guidance documents and industry standards
- Include regulatory justification using established precedents
- Maintain scientific rigor while acknowledging limitations

🔍 MANDATORY QUALITY CONTROLS:
- For every major recommendation, include clear reasoning explaining:
  * Why this approach was chosen over alternatives
  * What regulatory precedents support this decision
  * What risk factors were considered
  * How this aligns with regulatory expectations
- Use phrases like "This recommendation is based on..." and "The rationale for this approach is..."
- Provide confidence levels for key decisions where appropriate

${FORMATTING_STANDARDS}

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Demonstrate understanding of regulatory requirements and industry best practices
- Provide actionable, specific recommendations with clear rationale
- Include risk assessments and mitigation strategies where appropriate

🚨 UNIVERSAL CLINICAL PROTOCOL STANDARDS - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE:

🔬 SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY CHECKLIST:
✅ Use ONLY established, literature-supported biomarkers and measures (no fictional metrics)
✅ Label all investigational elements as "[INVESTIGATIONAL - REQUIRES VALIDATION]"
✅ Base mechanisms of action on published biological pathways with citations
✅ Include realistic data ranges from actual clinical experience
✅ Distinguish hypothesis-generating from validated clinical evidence
✅ Ground therapeutic rationales in established pathophysiology

📋 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST:
✅ Use precise regulatory terminology (Phase I/II/III terminology)
✅ Include phase-appropriate endpoints (safety for Phase I, efficacy for Phase II/III)
✅ Provide statistically justified sample sizes with power calculations
✅ Include comprehensive safety monitoring with predefined stopping rules
✅ Specify appropriate regulatory pathway (IND, IDE) requirements
✅ Address relevant FDA guidance documents for therapeutic area

🎯 STUDY DESIGN QUALITY CHECKLIST:
✅ Base inclusion/exclusion criteria on scientific rationale (not data mining)
✅ Include standard eligibility requirements for indication and patient safety
✅ Provide specific, implementable procedures (dose escalation, randomization, blinding)
✅ Generate realistic timelines based on enrollment feasibility
✅ Include appropriate control groups and statistical analysis plans
✅ Specify meaningful clinical endpoints aligned with regulatory expectations

📊 DATA & EVIDENCE QUALITY CHECKLIST:
✅ Frame retrospective analyses as "informing study design" not "proving efficacy"
✅ Acknowledge limitations of historical data and observational studies
✅ Include prospective validation plans for derived hypotheses/biomarkers
✅ Avoid superiority claims based on uncontrolled comparisons
✅ Distinguish between feasibility data and treatment validation
✅ Include appropriate statistical caveats for exploratory analyses

⚖️ ETHICAL & SAFETY CHECKLIST:
✅ Prioritize patient safety in all design decisions
✅ Include appropriate risk-benefit assessments
✅ Address vulnerable populations appropriately
✅ Include informed consent considerations for study procedures
✅ Consider health equity and diversity in recruitment strategies
✅ Address potential conflicts of interest transparently

📝 DOCUMENTATION EXCELLENCE CHECKLIST:
✅ Replace boilerplate language with study-specific, meaningful content
✅ Provide concrete, actionable procedures (not general statements)
✅ Use professional scientific language without overstatement
✅ Include specific safety/efficacy monitoring procedures
✅ Ensure internal consistency across document sections
✅ Flag assumptions/hypothetical elements clearly

🎯 THERAPEUTIC AREA ADAPTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Include indication-specific standard of care considerations
- Address disease-specific biomarkers and endpoints
- Incorporate appropriate patient reported outcome measures
- Consider indication-specific regulatory requirements
- Include therapeutic class pharmacovigilance considerations
- Address population-specific safety considerations

**DOSSIER CONTEXT:**
- Dossier Type: ${dossierType || 'Not specified'}
- Primary Indication: ${primaryIndication || 'Not specified'}
- Document Language: ${language}
- File Type: ${fileType || 'Unknown'}
- File Size: ${fileSize ? `${(fileSize / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2)} MB` : 'Unknown'}

**DOCUMENT TO VALIDATE:**
- File Name: ${fileName}
- User-Assigned Category: "${categoryDescription}"
- Expected Category Code: "${expectedCategory}"

**VALIDATION CRITERIA:**
1. **Category Validation**: Must contain required keywords: ${rules.required_keywords.join(', ')}
2. **Negative Validation**: Must NOT contain: ${rules.forbidden_keywords.join(', ')}
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Should align with ${rules.ich_guidelines}
4. **Structural Requirements**: Should contain ${rules.min_sections}+ of these sections: ${rules.regulatory_sections.join(', ')}
5. **File Type Validation**: Is ${fileType} appropriate for this category?
6. **Context Relevance**: Is content relevant to "${primaryIndication}"?
7. **Quality Assessment**: Is this a complete, professional document suitable for regulatory submission?

**ADDITIONAL VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- Document completeness and professional formatting
- Presence of required regulatory elements
- Absence of obviously irrelevant content
- Consistency with stated indication/disease area
- Appropriate level of detail for dossier category

**PRE-VALIDATION FINDINGS:**
- File Type Valid: ${isValidFileType ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
- File Size Valid: ${isValidFileSize ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
- Content Length: ${analysisText.length} characters analyzed

**DOCUMENT CONTENT:**
"""
${analysisText}
"""

**RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:**
Provide a EXTREMELY DETAILED validation assessment in JSON format only. No additional text before or after.

Consider that this document will be submitted to regulatory authorities and must meet professional standards.
